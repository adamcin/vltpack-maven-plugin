                The <a href="../embed-bundles-mojo.html">embed-bundles</a> goal is used to programmatically add OSGi
                bundles to the vault package. By default, it will execute once during the <em>prepare-package</em> phase.
                Bundles will be inserted into the package at the path specified by the <em>bundleInstallPath</em>
                configuration parameter, with the effective node name matching the pattern
                <em>[articleId]-[version].jar</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Different bundles may be embedded at different bundleInstallPaths in the same package by using multiple
                executions of this goal, each with their own bundleInstallPath value.

            <p>
                The <a href="../vault-inf-mojo.html">vault-inf</a> goal will modify the workspaceFilter to include the
                embedded bundle paths under an appropriate filter root if it is not already included.

            <p>
                The following example illustrates how to configure your POM to embed each type of
                dependency: bundles, packages, and install hooks. Notice that the embed configurations
                reference project dependencies by artifactId, which is similar to the convention used
                by the maven-bundle-plugin.
