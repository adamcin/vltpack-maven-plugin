            <subsection name="Project Structure at a glance">
                <source>
[basedir]
+- src/main/content/
|  +- jcr_root/             # jcr_root contains repository content like jsp and .content.xml files
|  \- META-INF/vault/
|     \- filter.xml         # the META-INF/vault/filter.xml defines the package Workspace Filter
\- pom.xml</source>
                <p>
                    Keeping your vlt workspace under <tt>src/main/content</tt> is merely a convention. It is possible to
                    specify any directory containing the <tt>jcr_root</tt> and <tt>META-INF/vault</tt> paths in your
                    pom.xml using a &lt;resource&gt; element, just so long as the jcr_root and META-INF folders wind up
                    in <tt>target/classes</tt> by the time the <tt>package</tt> lifecycle phase starts.
                </p>

                <p>
                    First start with a basic vltpack pom.xml as described on the <a href="usage.html">Usage</a> page.
                    Notice that it has added the <tt>src/main/content</tt> path as a resource root for the
                    maven-resources-plugin. This will be the root of your vlt working copy. Create the
                    <tt>src/main/content</tt> directory if it doesn't exist.
                </p>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Create your Workspace Filter">
                <p>
                    It's generally not a good idea to try to checkout the entire repository for simple package project,
                    so you should specify your desired package Workspace Filter <strong>first</strong>, so that the vlt
                    checkout command can be executed faster and more reliably.
                </p>
                <p>
                    First, create the <tt>META-INF/vault</tt> directory under <tt>src/main/content</tt>, then create a
                    <tt>filter.xml</tt> file under <tt>META-INF/vault</tt> with the following basic structure:
                </p>
                <source>
<![CDATA[<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<workspaceFilter version="1.0">
    <filter root="/apps/myApp" />
    <filter root="/etc/designs/myApp" />
</workspaceFilter>]]>
                </source>
            </subsection>
            <subsection name="Check out your vlt workspace">
                <p>
                    Next, you will checkout your application code into the <tt>src/main/content</tt> directory. Make
                    sure you have followed Adobe's
                    <a href="http://dev.day.com/docs/en/cq/current/developing/developmenttools/developing_with_eclipse.html#Installing%20FileVault%20(VLT)">
                        instructions for installing VLT
                    </a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With VLT installed and your CQ server running at localhost:4502, open a terminal window and navigate
                    to your project directory. Then execute the following command:
                </p>
                <source>vlt --credentials admin:admin checkout http://localhost:4502/crx src/main/content</source>
