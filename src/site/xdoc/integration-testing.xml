            <p>
                The <a href="embed-bundles-mojo.html">embed-bundles</a> goal is used to programmatically add OSGi
                bundles to the vault package. By default, it will execute once during the <tt>prepare-package</tt> phase.
                Bundles will be inserted into the package at the path specified by the <tt>bundleInstallPath</tt>
                configuration parameter, with the effective node name matching the pattern
                <tt>[articleId]-[version].jar</tt>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Different bundles may be embedded at different <tt>bundleInstallPath</tt>s in the same package by using
                multiple executions of this goal, each with their own <tt>bundleInstallPath</tt> value.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <a href="vault-inf-mojo.html">vault-inf</a> goal will modify the workspaceFilter to include the
                embedded bundle paths under an appropriate filter root if it is not already included.
