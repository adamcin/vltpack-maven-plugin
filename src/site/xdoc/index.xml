            <p>
                The vltpack-maven-plugin is a tool for developers of Adobe CQ/CRX/Granite-based applications to
                create content package artifacts from vlt working copies.
            </p>
        </section>
        <section name="CRX Content Package Creation">
            <p>
                Developers might use
                <a href="http://dev.day.com/docs/en/crx/current/how_to/how_to_use_the_vlttool.html">Adobe's VLT tool</a>
                to develop their application content, code, and configuration in their local Granite instance, and then
                create CRX content packages to deploy that content, code, and configuration to shared repositories and
                production CRX servers.
            </p>
            <p>
                The vltpack-maven-plugin defines a "vltpack" packaging type to represent CRX content packages. It
                provides a set of maven goals mapped to the default lifecycle (<tt>compile</tt>, <tt>test</tt>,
                <tt>package</tt>, <tt>install</tt>, <tt>deploy</tt>)
                that are designed to assemble the package pieces from a VLT working copy, overlay project properties,
                and embed any referenced maven dependencies, and then deploy that assembled package to a central maven
                artifact repository like Nexus or Artifactory.

        <section name="Integration Test Support">
            <p>
                In addition to the basic package creation goals, a number of goals have been provided to support the use
                of the maven-failsafe-plugin for execution of integration tests based on the
                <a href="http://sling.apache.org/site/sling-testing-tools.html">Sling JUnit Framework</a>.
                These are all mapped to the <tt>pre-integration-test</tt> phase so that they may be easily executed
                immediately prior to the execution of the maven-failsafe-plugin's <tt>integration-test</tt> goal. Simply
                use a profile to set the <tt>supportITs</tt> user property to enable the following goals:

                    Enable consistent and reliable assembly of vault packages, and avoid interfering with the
                    development process that produces the contents of those packages, with specific consideration
                    given to Adobe's own instructions for development using the vlt tool.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Support a test-driven maven lifecycle using the
                    <a href="Sling JUnit Framework">Sling JUnit integration test framework</a>.
                    Bundle and package deployment goals are mapped to the pre-integration-test phase (not the install
                    phase) so that maven install and deploy phases can be made dependent on successful test execution.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Provide a consistent configuration model such that any two maven goals that do similar things
                    will accept a similar set of configuration parameters/property names.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Support an iterative development process for the package artifact itself by exposing convenient
                    property names for configuration values that are likely to vary for local development, so that
                    maven profiles and command-line scripts may be reused across modules and across projects.
